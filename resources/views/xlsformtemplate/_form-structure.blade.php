    <h2>Review Form Structure</h2>
    <p>The main structure of your form is displayed below. To make it easier for your form users to make sense of the data, you can add the "data subject" of your form. If you have different sections of your form, defined by ODK Groups or Repeats, you may choose different data subjects for different sections. For example, you may have a form that asks questions about the <b>household</b>, and then a repeating section that asks questions about the <b>household members</b></p>
